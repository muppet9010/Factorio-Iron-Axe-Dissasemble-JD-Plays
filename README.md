# Iron-Axe-Dissasemble-JD-Plays


A mod designed for a one off use by JD-Plays.

It adds a quick hand craftable recipe that disassembles an Iron Axe in to an Iron Axe Head, a Iron Axe handle and a 0.17 Mock Basic Mining Tool
The Iron Axe Head is a useless lump of metal with the graphics of the Iron Axe part.
The Iron Axe Handle has a fuel value equal to raw wood (4MJ) and the graphics of the Iron Axe part.
The Mock Basic Mining Tool is coloured the same as the GUI on grass. It is set to minimal durability when crafted directly in to your tool slot to reduce the green usage bar.
