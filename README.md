# Iron-Axe-Dissasemble-JD-Plays


A mod designed for a one off use by JD-Plays.

It adds a quick hand craftable recipe that disassembles an Iron Axe in to an Iron Axe Head and an Iron Axe handle.
The Iron Axe Head is a useless lump of metal with the graphics of the Iron Axe part.
The Iron Axe Handle has a fuel value equal to raw wood (4MJ) and the graphics of the Iron Axe part.
